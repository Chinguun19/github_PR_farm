## Usage

### Creating Repositories and PRs

```bash
npm run pr-farm:setup
# or
yarn pr-farm:setup
```

This will:
1. Create the specified number of repositories on your GitHub account
2. Clone each repository locally
3. Create feature branches
4. Make changes to files
5. Commit changes and push to GitHub
6. Create pull requests

### Reviewing and Merging PRs

```bash
npm run pr-farm:review
# or
yarn pr-farm:review
```

This will:
1. Find all open pull requests in your repositories
2. Add comments to the PRs
3. Approve the PRs
4. Merge the PRs (if configured to do so)

### Running Scheduled Operations

```bash
npm run pr-farm:start
# or
yarn pr-farm:start
```

This will start a scheduler that:
1. Runs PR creation at scheduled times (default: daily at 10:00 AM)
2. Runs PR review/merging at scheduled times (default: daily at 2:00 PM)
3. Logs all operations to the logs directory
